# WebGl2-2D-Animation

My first attempts at creating 2D animation using WebGL2. This code uses one html file, one JavaScript file, and multiple GLSL and JSON files.

To run the code:
1) Download the files in this repository
2) Open a terminal and go to the location where you saved these files
3) Enter ```python -m http.server``` in your terminal
4) Navigate to http://localhost:8000/mp2.html

The final program will have buttons to choose which animation to show. Examples of some of the animations included are below.
